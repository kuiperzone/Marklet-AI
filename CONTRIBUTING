# CONTRIBUTING

Marklet is open-source software, but that does not mean the author(s) must accept contributions from the public internet.


## What is Wanted

Feedback in the form of discussion is appreciated and helps the author(s) understand how people use the software and what can be
improved.

Create or contribute to a discussion here:

https://github.com/kuiperzone/Marklet/discussions

You are free to express your thoughts as you wish. Comments will be seen and understood by a real human being and not treated as
checkbox "aggregate data". The software does not collect or send back data. It is better to listen and to understand.


## Pull Requests

If you spot a bug and wish to submit a pull request that fixes it, despite what is said above, please do so. Such contributions
will be treated as suggestions and may or may not be accepted. PR code may be re-written.

For small changes (e.g. a few lines or minor fixes), by submitting a pull request, you agree to place your contribution in the
public domain. This keeps the project free of predatory copyright claims and entanglements.

It is suggested that you do not submit large unsolicited pull requests involving design changes, significant new features, or
major ideas. Better to discuss those first.

Please do not submit AI-generated code. Despite being an "AI project", AI is something which should be treated with care.
